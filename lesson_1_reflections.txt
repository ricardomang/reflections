How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?

It showed me what was spelled wrong, and why the game wasn't 
working correctly. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You'd be able to see your growth, and what you did wrong
in previous code, and therefore capitalize and not make
as many mistakes. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros, the amount of Git commits doesn't end up making you
feel overwhelmed. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because all files could possibly be changed at one time. 

How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?

The biggest thing is that you know that you can go back
to the same state that you were in, and that you can
also try new things.. If you break something you 
can just go back to a previous state so theres 
no reason to fear anything!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Honestly I want to use git for everything, so that I can develop bigger projects without fear!
